  //
  // 2. To confirm if everything is working as expected, we can get all webhooks for apps and check if the ORDER_CONFIRMED webhooks were created.

  //
  // 3. If something went wrong, we can roll back the migration by uncommenting this line:
  // await webhookMigrator.DANGEROUS_DELETE_APP_WEBHOOK_BY_NAME(orderConfirmedAsyncWebhook.name);
  // It will delete the ORDER_CONFIRMED webhooks created above.
  //
  // 2nd step (after two weeks)
  // 1. Comment the 1st step code above.
  // 2. Delete the ORDER_CREATED and ORDER_FULFILLED webhooks by uncommenting this line:
  // await webhookMigrator.DANGEROUS_DELETE_APP_WEBHOOK_BY_NAME("OrderCreated");
  // await webhookMigrator.DANGEROUS_DELETE_APP_WEBHOOK_BY_NAME("OrderFulfilled");
  //
  // Migrations completed âœ…. The file remains as an artefact.
